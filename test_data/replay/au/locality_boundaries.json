Further information about contributors to Administrative Boundaries is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/).\r\n\r\nThe full Administrative Boundaries dataset contains boundaries in seven themes: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) boundaries, electoral boundaries, state and territory boundaries, local government areas, suburbs/localities, wards and town points.\r\n\r\nAs at November 2019, users have the option to download datasets with feature coordinates referencing the new Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020) in addition to datasets on the GDA94 datum.\r\n\r\nFor GDA2020 datasets, the name of the zip folder and the root folder (once extracted) include a reference to GDA2020. For GDA94 datasets, the zip and root folder names do not contain the datum name (i.e. they remain the same as previous releases).\r\n\r\nFor example, the zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries downloaded in GDA2020 for November 2019 looks like this:\r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile_GDA2020; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat_GDA2020\r\n\r\nThe zip and root folder for Administrative Boundaries in GDA94 for November 2019 looks like this: \r\n\r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_ESRIShapefileorDBFfile; or \r\n       •\tNOV19_AdminBounds_MapInfoTABFormat\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the datum chosen, files within the respective folder use exactly the same naming structures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on Administrative Boundaries, including FAQs on the data, is available [here](https://geoscape.com.au/data/administrative-boundaries/) through Geoscape Australia’s network of [partners](https://geoscape.com.au/partners/). They provide a range of commercial products based on Administrative Boundaries, including software solutions, consultancy and support.\r\n\r\nNote: On 1 October 2020, PSMA Australia Limited began trading as Geoscape Australia. \r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government has negotiated the release of Administrative Boundaries to the whole economy under an [open CCBY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\nUsers must only use the data in ways that are consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles issued under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).\r\n\r\n**Users must also note the following attribution requirements:**\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for the Licensed Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n\r\n_Preferred attribution for Adapted Material:_\r\n\r\n> _Incorporates or developed using Administrative Boundaries © [Geoscape Australia](https://geoscape.com.au/legal/data-copyright-and-disclaimer/) licensed by the Commonwealth of Australia under_ [_Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (CC BY 4.0)_](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).","distributions":[{"description":"The attribute table has been joined in this shapefile to aid immediate use.","downloadURL":"https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/91e70237-d9d1-4719-a82f-e71b811154c6/resource/5e295412-357c-49a2-98d5-6caf099c2339/download/nsw_loc_polygon_shp.zip","format":"SHP","identifier":"dist-dga-5e295412-357c-49a2-98d5-6caf099c2339","issued":"2018-11-19T22:16:51Z","license":{"name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"},"mediaType":"application/zip","modified":"2021-02-22T04:44:35Z","source":{"id":"dga","name":"data.gov.au"},"title":"NSW_LOCALITY_POLYGON_shp.zip"},{"description":"GDA2020","downloadURL":"https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/91e70237-d9d1-4719-a82f-e71b811154c6/resource/5f5ca807-0586-4b93-87dd-891691985272/download/nsw_loc_polygon_shp_gda2020.zip","format":"SHP","identifier":"dist-dga-5f5ca807-0586-4b93-87dd-891691985272","issued":"2019-11-19T00:32:34Z","license":{"name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"},"mediaType":"application/zip","modified":"2021-02-22T04:45:08Z","source":{"id":"dga","name":"data.gov.au"},"title":"NSW_LOCALITY_POLYGON_shp GDA2020.zip"},{"description":"View the data in this dataset online via an online map","downloadURL":"https://data.gov.au/geoserver/nsw-suburb-locality-boundaries-psma-administrative-boundaries/wms?request=GetCapabilities","format":"WMS","identifier":"dist-dga-7ce6a137-60b5-44e4-90a4-6fb04558ef7d","issued":"2019-08-20T17:19:52Z","license":{"name":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"},"modified":"2019-08-21T03:19:52Z","source":{"id":"dga","name":"data.gov.au"},"title":"NSW Suburb/Locality Boundaries -
